If you tried this abroad, such things will be very difficult, even your favorite London.\n.\nAlso, an average Indian can easily identify you as a person from a good family, so they won't mind helping you out. From your body, your dressing sense, your cameras, you look as upper middle class person to those who don't know you. That would be another advantage. In North and West India, when you talk in English to hotels/hostels or any other services, the language would give you an edge.\n.\nYou look innocent. So, best wishes for your journey.",
